                                <p>I was born December 10,1970 at 6:13am. My mother was in laber for 21 hours bringing me into this world.
                                        I was born in Dayton, OH and where I spent the next 18 years of my life. After High School, 
                                        I moved to the DMV area (Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia). I love music and computers, 
                                        I’ve been mixing and mastering audio tracks for over 10 years. I’ve also been working professionally in the IT field for over 20 years. 
                                        My life is very colorful, I’ve traveled to almost every state in America and including Paris, London, and Canada. 
                                        I have black Pub named Amos, he’s the closest thing I have to having A son. Me and my ex-wife still live together and ironically get along better after the divorce. 
                                        My next move in life is to finish Bootcamp class and work from home chilling and stacking money.
